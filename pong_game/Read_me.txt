Hey there!

Pong is a simple game where two players can play with a ball in the middle.
This particular game has been created using the turtle module in python.

The first player has to control the paddle using these controls:
'w' - Go up
's' - go down

The second player has to control the paddle using these controls:
'up arrow key' - Go up
'down arrow key' - go down

enjoy!

Here is the video sample of the game.
